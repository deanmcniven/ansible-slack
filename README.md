# slack

Ansible role to install the Slack snap app.

This is a workaround until ansible supports a snap type.

## Progress Updates
* Ansible currently does not have a snap module, see: https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/44939
* Update (26/10/2018): This feature should be available in ansible 2.8 when it is released
